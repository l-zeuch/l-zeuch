## Hu? Oh, hi!
> A fan of well documented, comprehensible code.

If you found your way here you know me either in real life (welcome to the dark side!) or via Discord, most probably from the [YAGPDB](https://yagpdb.xyz/) support server.
Either way: Take a look around, maybe you'll find something you like!

## About me
My name is Luca Zeuch, a high school student in the last year from Germany. My first programming experience started with Java, which was part of the curriculum in my computer science class, however I am good enough in C/C++ and Arduino and prefer those for more serious programming, when it comes down to optimizing. :^)<br/>
Programming started as a hobby of mine and it will ever be, so I would not say that I am fluent in these languages, rather I am able to understand them and use them with a lot of reading.

## Current Projects
There aren't many things you could call a serious project, however here is a short list:

- [`yagpdb-cc`](https://github.com/yagpdb-cc/yagpdb-cc): Contributed to that repository, unfortunately however I had to remove it due to some severe bugs (which got fixed)
- [`lagpdb-cc`](https://github.com/l-zeuch/lagpdb-cc): My personal repository with some high quality, well documented custom commands.
- [`Jobsoggt`](https://github.com/Goldscar1/Jobsjoggt): A small game in C++ some friends of mine and I planned to do - currently stale due to a lot of exams

## Various
Nothing much to say honestly.<br/>
I usually follow the [Git-flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) workflow, love reading, just playing around, experimenting. I still call it master.
