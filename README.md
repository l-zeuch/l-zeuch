# :wave: Welcome

> The "m" in "code" means "magic".

Hi! I'm Luca Zeuch, a chemistry student at the [Universit√§t Bremen](https://uni-bremen.de/en). My activity primarily
revolves around [YAGPDB](https://yagpdb.xyz), a Discord bot I contribute(d) to and maintain its new documentation.

Currently, my time is mostly spent on my studies (Organic Chemistry is a meanie), though I do try to squeeze in the odd
learning session here and there. At the moment, I am *attempting* to learn the [Go Programming Language](https://go.dev).

### Projects

As of now, I primarily work on [YAGPDB's documentation](https://github.com/botlabs-gg/yagpdb-docs-v2), utilising
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io) to generate the static site. Some of my other projects include:

- A (Neo)Vim [syntax plugin][yagpdb.vim] for YAGPDB's custom scripting language
- My [flailing attempts at a website][lzeuch.de] (offline for now)
- A [game I wrote in 2018][game] as part of a CS course I took back then (archived)

### Contact

For general chat, feel free to mention `lzodd` on the Discord server linked below. If you prefer email, you can reach
out to me at `l-zeuch [at] email [dot] de`. Please say that you're coming from GitHub, so I don't mistake you for spam.
In other words, clearly state your intentions.
