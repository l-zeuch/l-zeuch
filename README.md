> The "m" in "code" stands for magic.

Hey there! My name is Luca Zeuch, a programming enthusiast and spare time tutor from Germany.

Currently I study chemistry at the University of Bremen.

Outside of code, I enjoy cooking, swimming, reading, and playing Badminton. Moreover, I find joy in finding out new things and going a little offroad in terms of logic and rationale, as a healthy balance so to speak.

Lastly, I am an active lifeguard helping out at the local swimming pool and lake.

## Current Projects

* [`yagpdb-cc`](https://github.com/yagpdb-cc/yagpdb-cc/) - A collection of Custom Commands for YAGPDB, a multipurpose Discord bot.
* [`lagpdb-cc`](https://github.com/l-zeuch/lagpdb-cc) - My own collection of a few more Custom Commands
* [`yagpdb.vim`](https://github.com/l-zeuch/yagpdb.vim) - An (N)Vim plugin to support syntax highlighting of YAGPDB Custom Commands.
* **YAGPDB Related:** I occasionally work on contributions to this bot, see [my fork of YAGPDB](https://github.com/l-zeuch/yagpdb)

Apart from these projects I also volunteer at my old school, teaching young students all sorts of tech related things, in close collaboration with the curriculum.
