## Hu? Oh, hi!
> A lover of comprehensible and maintainable code.

You either know me in real life or via Discord, most probably from the [YAGPDB](https://yagpdb.xyz/) support server.
In any case: Take a look around, maybe you find something you'll like!

## About me
My name is Luca Zeuch, a high school student in the last year from Germany. My first somewhat serious programming experience started with Java, which was part of the curriculum in my computer science class - My first languages howevere were C/C++ and Arduino, which I use in parallel. Mainly for "showing off" as my classmates like to say, but I think it is quite a good way to get the basic of your code down and then implement it in a high-level language.<br/>
Programming started as a hobby of mine and it will always be! I planned to make career in the software industry, however I don't think that I am proficient enough for this.<br>
Currently I am learning Rust and C# - I must admit, I totally understand the hype for Rust! I am always learning the other used languages, as well (you'll always learn new stuff).

## My "Projects"
There aren't many things you could call a serious project, however here is a short list:

- [`lagpdb-cc`](https://github.com/l-zeuch/lagpdb-cc): My personal repository with some high quality, well documented custom commands and tutorials for [YAGPDB](https://yagpdb.xyz)
- [`yagpdb-cc`](https://github.com/yagpdb-cc/yagpdb-cc): The official YAGPDB custom commands repository; A few custom commands from me are in there!
- [`jobsjoggt`](https://github.com/JuLuSiLi/jobsjoggt): A small game in Rust some friends of mine and I planned to do - currently stale due to a lot of exams. For now, there is only a hello world code in there.

## Various
Nothing much to say honestly.<br/>
I usually follow the [Git-flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) workflow, love reading, just playing around, experimenting.<br>
I still call it master.<br>
