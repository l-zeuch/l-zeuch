## About Me
My name is Luca Zeuch, I am a programming enthusiast and ongoing air traffic controller from Germany.

I like to dip my toes into all sorts of stuff, depending on my current priorities. I also know a fair amount of Java and Arduino and like to mess around in Rust or C/C++.<br/>
You're most likely to know me from [YAGPDB](https://yagpdb.xyz), a multi-purpose, highly customisable Discord Bot, or in "real life" - in which case, hello there!

Programming started as a hobby and I don't plan on going beyond that, based on the fact that there are definitely people out there who are far more qualified than I am.

## Current Projects
* [`yagpdb-cc`](github.com/yagpdb-cc/yagpdb-cc) - A curated collection of custom commands for the YAGPDB Discord Bot.
* [`lagpdb-cc`](github.com/l-zeuch/lagpdb-cc) - My own, well documented collection of a few more custom commands.
* [`simple-things`](github.com/l-zeuch/simple-things) - My blog. The name may change in future, as it is a little too generic.

Apart from that I am working on contributions to [jonas747/yagpdb](github.com/jonas747/yagpdb), translating its documentation as well as being an active support member.
Additionally, I currently learn C# and Go, and plan on learning Rust and C more in-depth than I do at the moment.

I'm mostly active on Discord, you can find me on the [YAGPDB support server](https://discord.com/invite/4udtcA5). Alternatively, you can also join [my server](https://discord.gg/tFhxypKcvm). 

In the offline life I am also an active lifesaver helping out at the local swimming pools, play badminton and like skiing. I like to read lots and lots, nowadays however I feel like I am lacking the time read, as well as write short-ish essays. I'm hoping to pick that up again. I enjoy cooking, be that for myself, for friends, or the entire family.

Go away now : )
