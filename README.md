> The "m" in "code" stands for magic.

Hey there! My name is Luca Zeuch, a programming enthusiast and spare time tutor from Germany.

Currently I study chemistry at the University of Bremen.

Outside of code, I enjoy cooking, swimming, reading, and playing Badminton.
I like learning new stuff and forgetting them almost immediately.

## Current Projects

* [`yagpdb-cc`](https://github.com/yagpdb-cc/yagpdb-cc/) - A collection of Custom Commands for YAGPDB, a multipurpose Discord bot.
* [`website`](https://github.com/l-zeuch/website) - My own website and blog  (early WIP)
* [`yagpdb.vim`](https://github.com/l-zeuch/yagpdb.vim) - An (N)Vim plugin to support syntax highlighting of YAGPDB Custom Commands.
* **YAGPDB Related:** I occasionally work on contributions to this bot, see [my fork of YAGPDB](https://github.com/l-zeuch/yagpdb)

Apart from these projects I also volunteer at my old school, teaching young students all sorts of tech related things, in close collaboration with the curriculum.

## Other Interesting Stuff
